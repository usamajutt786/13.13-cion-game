# 13.13-cion-game
  For this assignment, you will create a game program using the  Coin  class from Programming Challenge 12. The program should have three instances of the  Coin   class: one representing a quarter, one representing a dime, and one representing a nickel. When the game begins, your starting balance is $0. During each round of the game, the program will toss the simulated coins. When a coin is tossed, the value of the coin is added to your balance if it lands heads-up. For example, if the quarter lands headsup, 25 cents is added to your balance. Nothing is added to your balance for coins that land tails-up. The game is over when your balance reaches $1 or more. If your balance is exactly $1, you win the game. You lose if your balance exceeds $1.
